# Work or Worth? A Quiz for Gig Workers Navigating Dignity

## Overview
This interactive web application provides a reflective quiz experience for gig workers to explore the value of their labor beyond just economic measures. The quiz helps workers recognize their worth in terms of resilience, emotional labor, and personal dignity.

## Purpose
This quiz is not meant to judge productivity, but to offer gig workers (and society at large) a reflective experience on the value of their labor — economic and emotional. The goal is to challenge the idea that income alone defines worth.

## Target Audience
Gig workers — including delivery drivers, freelance designers, Uber drivers, online remote taskers (Fiverr, Upwork), and other platform-based laborers who experience work in a fractured, unstable, and often invisible system.

## Features
- 8-question interactive quiz exploring different aspects of gig work
- Progress saving (answers are stored locally in browser storage)
- Visual results that compare economic income to true personal value
- Option to save results as a beautifully designed PDF "Dignity Card"
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Technical Details
- Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Uses localStorage for data persistence
- Uses jsPDF library for PDF generation
- No backend required - all data stays on the user's device
